toc::[]

OpenShift Serverless Logic enables developers or architects to define declarative workflow models that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications.

OpenShift Serverless Logic is also designed to write workflows in formats (JSON or YAML) that might be better suited for developing and deploying serverless applications in cloud or container environments.


[NOTE]
====
Because {ServerlessProductName} releases on a different cadence from {ocp-product-title}, the {ServerlessProductName} documentation is now available as separate documentation sets for each minor version of the product. 

The {ServerlessProductName} documentation is available at link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/[].

Documentation for specific versions is available using the version selector dropdown, or directly by adding the version to the URL, for example, link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.28[].

In addition, the {ServerlessProductName} documentation is also available on the Red Hat Portal at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/[].

For additional information about the {ServerlessProductName} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ossrvless[Platform Life Cycle Policy].
