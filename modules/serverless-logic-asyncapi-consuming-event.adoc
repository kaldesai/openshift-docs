= Consuming an event

To enable seamless event consumption, define the Kafka server, subscription channel, and a function that consumes the event, and then invoke the function in your workflow. When your workflow reaches the function, it pauses and waits for the specific event from the Kafka topic before continuing.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have created the `asyncAPI.yaml` file and your project `classpath`.
* Your project includes necessary dependencies for AsyncAPI and Kafka.

.Procedure

. Define the Kafka Server in your `asyncAPI.yaml` file as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
servers:
 development:
   url: localhost:9092
   description: Development server
   protocol: kafka
   protocolVersion: '1.0.0'
----

. Create a subscription channel in the `asyncAPI.yaml` file.
+
The following example shows to define a subscription channel named `wait`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
channels:
 wait:
   description: A message channel
   subscribe:
     operationId: consumeWait
     summary: Get messages
     message:
       $ref: '#/components/messages/message'
----

. Add a function in your workflow that uses the `asyncapi` type and points to the `consumeWait` operation ID.
+
[source,json]
----
{
 "functions": [
   {
     "name": "consumeEvent",
     "type": "asyncapi",
     "operation": "asyncAPI.yaml#consumeWait"
   }
 ]
}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `operation` property supports `http`, `https`, and `file` schemas for the URI. If no schema is specified, it assumes the file is on the project classpath.
====

. In your workflow, invoke the `consumeEvent` function within an operation state:
+
.Example of invoking the function
[source,json]
----
{
 "states": [
   {
     "name": "waitForEvent",
     "type": "operation",
     "actions": [
       {
         "functionRef": "consumeEvent"
       }
     ]
   }
 ]
}
----

. Execute the workflow.
+
When the workflow reaches the `waitForEvent` state, it pauses.
