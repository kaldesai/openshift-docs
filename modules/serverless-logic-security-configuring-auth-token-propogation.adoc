= Configuring authorization token propagation

You can configure your workflow to forward an authorization token it receives during its creation to the secured third-party services it orchestrates. This token propagation allows your workflow to authenticate service requests without needing to acquire new tokens.

You must configure token propagation individually for each security scheme defined in your OpenAPI specification.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have access to the OpenAPI specification files.
* Your OpenAPI specification defines a security scheme using either the `oauth2` or `http` bearer type.
* Your workflow is designed to receive an authorization token during its creation for example, from an API gateway, client app, or another service.
* You have access to the application properties file or environment variable setup.

.Procedure

. Enable token propagation for the security scheme by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].token-propagation=true
----
+
You can replace `[filename]` with the sanitized name of your OpenAPI specification file for example, `security_example_json` and `[security_scheme_name]` with the sanitized name of the security scheme for example, `oauth_example`.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.oauth_example.token-propagation=true
----
+
This setting enables token propagation for all OpenAPI operations secured by the specified security scheme.

. If your application uses a custom header instead of the standard `Authorization` header to carry the token, configure the header name by adding the following property: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].header-name=[http_header_name]
----
+
You can replace `[http_header_name]` with the custom header name your client application uses.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.oauth_example.header-name=MyCustomAuthHeader
----
+
When this property is set, the workflow reads the authorization token from the specified header instead of the default `Authorization` header.
