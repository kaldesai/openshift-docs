= Overview of OAuth 2.0 orchestration for third-party services

When orchestrating third-party service calls, {ServerlessLogicProductName} enables you to secure interactions using OAuth 2.0 authentication. OAuth 2.0 ensures that your workflows can authenticate with external services safely without handling user credentials directly.

{ServerlessLogicProductName} supports two OAuth 2.0 authentication options for invoking secured third-party services during workflow execution:

* Authorization token propagation

* OIDC client authentication

You can choose either option depending on your workflow requirements and third-party service specifications.

[id="serverless-logic-security-authorization-token-propagation_{context}"]
== Authorization token propagation

With authorization token propagation, a workflow forwards the authorization token received during its creation to the third-party service. This method is useful when the initiating client already holds a valid token, and you want the workflow to act on behalf of that client.

When you configure token propagation, {ServerlessLogicProductName} automatically injects the token into outgoing OpenAPI calls secured with the OAuth 2.0 or HTTP bearer schemes.

You can choose this option when the client initiates the workflow with an authorization token or you want to maintain the identity and context of the initiating client throughout the workflow.

You must configure token propagation individually for each security scheme. Once enabled, the token applies to all OpenAPI operations that use the configured scheme.

[id="serverless-logic-security-oidc-client-authentication_{context}"]
== OIDC client authentication

With OIDC client authentication, the workflow itself authenticates directly with the third-party service by using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) client configuration. {ServerlessLogicProductName} relies on a configured `OidcClient` to fetch and manage access tokens for outgoing service calls.

When you configure an OIDC client, {ServerlessLogicProductName} handles token acquisition and renewal automatically during the workflow execution.

You can choose this option when the workflow needs to authenticate independently, without relying on client-passed tokens or you need stronger separation between clients and service accounts.

You must add the Quarkus OIDC Client Filter extension to your project and configure the required OIDC client properties to enable this approach.
