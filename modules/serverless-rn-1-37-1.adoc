== Fixed issues

3scale Kourier gateway crash due to file descriptor limits on {ocp-product-title} 4.21::

Before this update, {ocp-product-title} 4.21 and later used a reduced default soft limit for the number of open files when running the `3scale Kourier gateway` with {ServerlessProductName} 1.37.0 and earlier. As a consequence, the `3scale Kourier gateway` could crash with the `socket(2) failed, got error: Too many open files` error. With this release, the `3scale Kourier gateway` deployment sets the soft limit for the maximum number of open files to the value of the hard limit.
As a result, the `3scale Kourier gateway` no longer crashes due to file descriptor limits on {ocp-product-title} 4.21.

[id="known-issues-1-37-1_{context}"]
== Known issues

Python runtime limited to 1024 open files on {ocp-product-title} 4.21::

On {ocp-product-title} 4.21, the default `ulimit -n` soft limit for the number of open files is set to 1024, reduced from 1048576 in earlier {ocp-product-title} releases up to version 4.20. The hard limit remains 524288. As a result, Serverless functions that use the Python runtime cannot open more than 1024 file descriptors, such as open files or TCP sockets.
