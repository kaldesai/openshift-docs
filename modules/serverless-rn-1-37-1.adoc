== Fixed issues

3scale Kourier gateway crash due to file descriptor limits on {ocp-product-title} 4.21::

Before this update, {ocp-product-title} 4.21 and later used a reduced default soft limit for the number of open files when running the `3scale Kourier gateway` with {ServerlessProductName} 1.37.0 and earlier. As a consequence, the `3scale Kourier gateway` could crash with the `socket(2) failed, got error: Too many open files` error. With this release, the `3scale Kourier gateway` deployment sets the soft limit for the maximum number of open files to the value of the hard limit.
As a result, the `3scale Kourier gateway` no longer crashes due to file descriptor limits on {ocp-product-title} 4.21.

Removal of unused webhook server initialization in {ServerlessLogicOperatorName}::

Before this update, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} initialized webhook server code that the operator did not use. As a consequence, the Operator included unnecessary initialization logic in its startup sequence. With this release, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} removes the unused webhook server initialization code. As a result, the Operator startup process no longer includes unused webhook server components.

Incorrect hibernate schema initialization option in Data Index PostgreSQL deployments::

Before this update, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} set the `QUARKUS_HIBERNATE_ORM_DATABASE_GENERATION=update` environment variable for Data Index PostgreSQL deployments. As a consequence, Data Index used an unintended database schema generation strategy. With this release, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} removes this environment variable from Operator-managed Data Index deployments. As a result, Data Index now uses the correct schema initialization configuration.

== Known issues

Python runtime limited to 1024 open files on {ocp-product-title} 4.21::

On {ocp-product-title} 4.21, the default `ulimit -n` soft limit for the number of open files is set to 1024, reduced from 1048576 in earlier {ocp-product-title} releases up to version 4.20. The hard limit remains 524288. As a result, Serverless functions that use the Python runtime cannot open more than 1024 file descriptors, such as open files or TCP sockets.
