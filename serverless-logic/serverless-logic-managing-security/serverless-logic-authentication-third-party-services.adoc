toc::[]

{ServerlessLogicProductName} provides flexible OAuth 2.0 authentication options to support different orchestration scenarios. You can either propagate an existing client token or configure the workflow to authenticate on its own using an OIDC client, depending on your system architecture and security requirements. You can implement and configure a workflow that orchestrates interactions with a REST service that is secured by OAuth 2.0.
